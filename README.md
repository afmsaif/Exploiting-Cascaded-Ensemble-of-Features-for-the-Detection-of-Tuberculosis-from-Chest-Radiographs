# Exploiting-Cascaded-Ensemble-of-Features-for-the-Detection-of-Tuberculosis-from-Chest-Radiographs
A cascaded ensembling method is proposed that combines both the hand-engineered and the deep learning-based features for the Tuberculosis detection task. To make the proposed model more generalized, rotation-invariant augmentation techniques are introduced which is found very effective in this task.
